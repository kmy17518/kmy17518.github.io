Hello! :wave: I'm a senior student at [Seoul National University](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en), where I work as a research intern at [Vision & Learning Lab](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/) under the guidance of Prof. [Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/). I am also fortunate to be collaborating with [Seungone Kim](https://seungonekim.github.io/) and Prof. [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/) on exciting ongoing research!


My primary research ambition is to advance **multi-source generative search** systems that integrate information seamlessly from diverse sources (personal chat logs to extensive knowledge databases) across multiple modalities (e.g., image, text). Specifically, I focus on (i) **Optimizing Reference Retrieval** to better understand context, user intent, and data source characteristics, and (ii) **Enhancing Response Generation** to produce reliable responses that are firmly grounded in these references. 

I believe this work has the potential to revolutionize how we access information, making the experience more accurate, intuitive and personalized.
